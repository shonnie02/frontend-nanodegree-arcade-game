Arcade Game Project for   Udacity
Author: Shavaun Brandy

  This is the third project for the Udacity Frontend Developer Course. The memory game is similar to the card game, concentration. Having a good eye-hand coordination is the key factor to being successful and winning the game.
  
  
## Uploading the Game to Your Computer

The game can be installed onto your computer by initially making sure that you are in the "shavauns-arcade-game" repository. 
Search for the green button that has the words Clone or Download, and proceed to click the button.  When the download is complete, search for the index folder and click.  The arcade game should open in the browser right away.
  

## Instructions for Playing the Arcade Game

The game is played by using the arrow keys to move the player in either an up, down, left or right direction.  Being able to move in these multiple directions will allow for maneuvering out of the path of the enemy vehicles that are moving across the screen above the player.  The object to the game is to successfully reach the water at the top of the screen without making contact with the enemy vehicles. One must be alert, instinctive, and have fast reaction time to be able to win the game.  Once you reach the water, you have won and the game is over.
